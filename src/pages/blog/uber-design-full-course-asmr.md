Uber Technologies, Inc. (Uber), formerly UberCab is an American mobility as a service provider, allowing users to book a car and driver to transport them in a way similar to a taxi. It is based in San Francisco with operations in approximately 72 countries and 10,500 cities in 2021. Its services include ride-hailing, food delivery (Uber Eats and Postmates), package delivery, couriers, freight transportation, electric bicycle and motorized scooter rental via a partnership with Lime, and Thames Clipper river bus transport in partnership with local operators. Uber does not own any vehicles, but receives a commission from each booking. Fares, which vary using a dynamic pricing model based on local supply and demand at the time of the booking, are quoted to the customer in advance.

Uber offers many different types of ride options. UberX is the most popular and the standard service of the company. UberXL, Uber Comfort, and Uber Black are other options offered by the company. UberXL cars are usually SUV-sized vehicles that can accommodate 6 passengers. Uber's premium service is Uber Black. Uber Black drivers have to be highly rated and drive more luxurious vehicles than UberX and UberXL. Uber Comfort guarantees a newer vehicle with more leg room.
