Twitter, Inc. is an American communications company based in San Francisco, California. The company operates the microblogging and social networking service Twitter. It previously operated the Vine short video app and Periscope livestreaming service.

Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of that year. By 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day. The company went public in November 2013. By the start of 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users.

On April 25, 2022, the Twitter board of directors agreed to a $44 billion buyout by Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, potentially making it one of the biggest deals to turn a company private. On July 8, 2022, Musk terminated the deal. As a result, Twitter shares experienced a fall and the company hired a US law firm to take legal action against Musk, launching a lawsuit against him in the Chancery Court of Delaware on July 12.
